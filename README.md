Problem Translations for [CodeAbbey](http://www.codeabbey.com)

Colleagues who contributed so far 10 or more translations:

- [Axel Werner](https://github.com/axel1973) - German
- [M-Padilla](https://github.com/M-Padilla) - Spanish
- [Ren Yuntao](https://github.com/renyuntao) - Chinese
- [Kuoa](https://github.com/kuoa) - Romanian
- [Aghiad Alzein](https://github.com/m-agh-ze) - Arabic
- [RodionGork](https://github.com/RodionGork) - Russian

We are going to create translations for problem statements of the CodeAbbey site. Most wanted languages are `French` and `Spanish` though we'll be glad to add `Italian`, `German`, `Hindi`, `Chinese` and others. As about `Russian` - the site's author is able to do it himself.

Currently we need volunteers to help in this process. If you have a good knowledge of some of the languages
mentioned above, and, preferably, of `Markdown` and `GitHub` - and want to lend us a hand, you are welcome. If you
do not feel well with GitHub advanced features, you are welcome to use its `gist` functionality. We will be glad if you put your name in the form `translated by John Doe` below the text (it would be shown on the site).

You are welcome to visit relevant [discussion at our forum](http://www.codeabbey.com/index/forum_topic/a3aa8b35e8fe646c6f6f4298035fcae4).

Here follow descriptions of both approaches.

###Working via GitHub forks and pull-requests

1. Choose some problem which you want to translate, it is ok to start with shorter ones.
2. Open it in your browser and change the `.../task_view/...` in URL to `.../task_text/...` to see the source text (you need to be logged in).
3. Make a fork of this repository to your GitHub account.
4. Create the new file for your work under the proper subfolder (two-letter language code, e.g. `fr`, `es`, etc.) with name like `task-N.md` where `N` is the number of the task (e.g. `task-5.md`)
5. Post the source text to the text area in the browser and start translation. Try to keep HTML blocks and empty lines unchanged. Also do not change URLs if you are not sure - I'll be able to fix this later if necessary.
6. You may click `Preview` to see how your future page looks like.
7. When done, click `Commit` below the text area and create pull-request, so that I can merge your work to main repository.

###Simpler way

1. Steps 1 and 2 are the same as above - chose some problem and open its source.
2. Log into GitHub (this will allow you to save / edit your work later), creating account if necessary.
3. Go to https://gist.github.com - it's a kind of shareable editor on steroids - you will see a form inviting to create new file (or gist, or paste - however they call it).
4. In the `Filename...` field enter something like `task-13-fr.md` - e.g. with the task number and language code - and make sure it ends with `.md` so you can review your work rendered properly.
5. Post the source text into textarea and start translation. Try to keep HTML blocks and empty lines unchanged. Also do not change URLs if you are not sure - I'll be able to fix this later if necessary.
6. When finished, click `Create secret gist` (not much secret, but this allow you not to abuse search engines with the text source). Now your work is saved in your account and you have a link for it.
7. Go to [Issues for this project](https://github.com/CodeAbbey/Translations/issues) and create another issue, posting url to your gist here and shortly describing what task and to which language is translated.
