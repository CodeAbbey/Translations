Triangle is called **right** when one of its three angles is **right angle**, equal to 90Â° - i.e. sides of
this angle are orthogonal.

Such triangles are important since for them the **Pythagorean Theorem** works. Let's recollect it.

Sides, adjacent to the right angle of such triangle, are called **legs** and the third side is **hypotenuse**.
The theorem states that length of hypotenuse is determined by the lengths of legs with simple formula:

    c^2 = a^2 + b^2
	
	    or
		
	c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)

Where `c` is the length of hypotenuse, while `a` and `b` are lengths of legs.

Famous example of the right triangle is one with sides of `3`, `4` and `5` units. Really, for them theorem holds:

    5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2
	
	    or
	
	25 = 9 + 16

In this task you will use this theorem to write a program which could determine, whether the triangle is right,
or it is **acute**, or **obtuse**:

- for acute triangle its longest side is shorter than hypotenuse should be;
- for obtuse triangle its longest side is longer than hypotenuse should be.

**Input data** contains the number of triangles in the first line.  
Next lines describe one triangle each. Descriptions consist of three values - lengths of sides. Largest value would
always be the last of three for simplicity.  
**Answers** should have one of the letters `R` (right), `A` (acute) or `O` (obtuse) for each of triangles. Letters
should be separated by spaces.

Example:

    input data:
	3
	6 8 9
	9 12 15
	16 12 22
	
	answer:
	A R O
