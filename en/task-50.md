<!-- #Palindrome -->
The word or whole phrase which has the same sequence of letters in both directions is called a **palindrome**. Here are
few examples:

    Stats
	Amore, Roma
	No 'x' in Nixon
	Was it a cat I saw?

As you see, case of the letters is ignored. Spaces and punctuations are ignored too.

Your goal in this programming exercise is to determine, whether the phrase represents a palindrome or not.

**Input data** contains number of phrases in the first line.  
Next lines contain one phrase each.  
**Answer** should have a single letter (space separated) for each phrase: `Y` if it is a palindrome and `N` if not.

Example:

    input data:
	3
	Stars
	O, a kak Uwakov lil vo kawu kakao!
	Some men interpret nine memos
	
	answer:
	N Y Y
