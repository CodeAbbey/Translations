<!-- #Title -->

The task is just the same as [Fibonacci Divisibility](./fibonacci-divisibility), however, input values here are greater
to prevent you from implementing straightforward calculations using long arithmetics (*this allows users in Java
or Python to solve the mentioned task easily enough*).

You should implement solution which works fast. A second or two is sufficient to run the proper solution (even with
not very modern computer).

*Hint: you need not long arithmetic for this task.*

**Input data** in the first line will contain the number of test-cases.  
Next line will contain exactly this of divisors `M` for which you should give answers.  
**Answer** should contain indices of members of Fibonacci Sequence, separated by spaces.

Example:

    input data:
	2
	233328 433156
	
	answer:
	1620 282

Values will not exceed `2000000`.
