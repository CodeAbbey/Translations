Quite a simple task - just to start learning strings...

**Input data** will contain a single string of small latin letters and few spaces.  
**Answer** should contain the string of the same length with the same characters but in reverse order.

Example:

    input data:
	four score and seven years ago
	
	answer:
	oga sraey neves dna erocs ruof

Though some languages especially functional has built-in function for this, please try perform it on your own and
'in-place' i.e. moving characters of the same string instead of copying them to the new one.
