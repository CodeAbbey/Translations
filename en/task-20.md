This is a simple problem to get introduced to string processing. We will be given several lines of text - and for each
of them we want to know the number of vowels (i.e. letters `a, o, u, i, e, y`). **Note:** that `y` is regarded as
vowel for purpose of this task.

*Though simple, this technic is important in cipher-breaking approaches. For example refer to
[Caesar Cipher Cracker](./caesar-cipher-cracker) problem.*

**Input data** contain number of test-cases in the first line.  
Then the specified number of lines follows each representing one test-case.  
Lines consist only of lowercase English (Latin) letters and spaces.  
**Answer** should contain the number of vowels in each line, separated by spaces.

Example:

    input data:
	4
	abracadabra
	pear tree
	o a kak ushakov lil vo kashu kakao
	my pyx
	
	answer:
	5 4 13 2
