Today I wanted to create new task and found it is `April 1 2014` - the
[Fool's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day)
when people are trying to overjoke each other.

So here is a small programming problem **without the problem statement**. Nevertheless you can do it! Good luck! :)

Example:

    input data:
	5
	1 2
	1 2 3
	2 3 4
	2 4 6 8 10
	7 11 19
	
	answer:
	5 14 29 220 531
