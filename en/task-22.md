_My colleague have retold me this puzzle after visiting an interview at local office of Oracle company.
I hope I remember it correctly._

John and Mary founded **J&M publishing house** and bought two old printers to equip it.

Now they have their first commercial deal - to print a document consisting of `N` pages.

It appears that printers work at different speed. One produces a page in `X` seconds and other does it in `Y` seconds.

So now company founders are curious about minimum time they can spend on printing the whole document with two printers.

**Input data** contains number of test cases in the first line.  
Then test-cases will follow, each in separate line.  
Each testcase contains three integer values - `X Y N`, where `N` will not exceed `1,000,000,000`.  
**Answer** should contain minumum printing times for each of testcases, separated by spaces.

Example:

	input data:
	2
	1 1 5
	3 5 4
	
	answer:
	3 9
