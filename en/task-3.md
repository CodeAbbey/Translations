If you already learned how to write program with a simple loop from [Sum in Loop][prevtask] task,
this new exercise will be just a simple modification.

[prevtask]: ./sum-in-loop

Now we are given several pairs of values and we want to calculate sum for each pair.  

**Input data** will contain the total count of pairs to process in the first line.  
The following lines will contain pairs themselves - one pair at each line.  
**Answer** should contain the results separated by spaces.

Example:

    data:
    3
    100 8
    15 245
    1945 54
    
    answer:
    108 260 1999
